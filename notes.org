* De-coupling FireflyApplication and FireflyDisplay

  Right now the display classes make assumptions about the structure
  of the application. We want to remove this and let the displays work
  independently of the QApplication.

** TODO [0/1] Ion chambers
   - [ ] Respond to clicks of the details button
** TODO [0/2] Component selector
   - [ ] Pass the app's instrument registry down to the component selector
   - [ ] Send the registry initially when the component selector is created
** TODO [0/1] Detector list
   - [ ] Have the detector list respond to registry changed signals (like component_selector)
** TODO [0/3] Line scan plan window
   - [ ] Do the number of regions change properly
   - [ ] Can the number of regions be reset
   - [ ] Do the component selector options update properly (update_devices called from QApplication)
** TODO [/] Status window
   - [ ] Application connects StatusDisplay.bss_window_requested -> app.show_bss_window_action.trigger
